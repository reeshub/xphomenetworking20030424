                this book<br>
                </b></font>
                <font face="Verdana" color="#000080">On October 25, 2001, I 
                attended the Windows XP launch event in New York's Times Square, 
                which ended up being an unfortunately boring affair, despite the 
                general excitement over Microsoft's most impressive--and 
                consumer friendly--operating system product ever. Microsoft 
                Chairman and Chief Software Architect Bill Gates presided over 
                the monotonous procession, which featured highlights such as the 
                &quot;death of DOS,&quot; a lot of product demonstrations, a goofy &quot;Who 
                Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; bit with Regis Philbin, and some 
                general back-slapping.</font><p>
                <font face="Verdana" color="#000080"><font size="2">I was almost 
                falling asleep by the time the launch event came to a close, 
                when Gates suddenly started wrapping things up. A PowerPoint 
                slide filled the massive video screens behind him, and my eyes 
                refocused, and a smile came to my face. Gates was talking about 
                the best features in Windows XP, and listed on the slide above 
                him were the following bullet points:<br>

                I was smiling because I had just proposed the book you're now 
                reading to Hungry Minds, which has since become part of the 
                Wiley family. Hungry Minds had also published my previous book,
                <a href="http://www.xpdigitalmedia.com">
                Great Windows XP Digital Media</a>, 
                which covers about half of the topics on the Gates slide 
                mentioned above. This book, <i>Windows XP Home Networking</i>, 
                neatly covers the other half.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#000080">I love it when 
                a plan comes together.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#000080">Even Bill Gates 
                himself apparently agrees that the digital media and networking 
                technologies in Windows XP are the best reasons to upgrade. And 
                that, really, is what this is all about. You can create home 
                networks (and work with various digital media technologies) with 
                previous Windows versions, but it isn't as good. It isn't as 
                fun. And it certainly isn't as easy. The further you go back in 
                time, in fact, the harder and more technical these tasks become.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#000080">And technical 
                means boring. If you have to know how to manually assign IP 
                address and DNS settings, perform port forwarding, or configure 
                technologies with bizarre names like NAT, then the topic we're 
                discussing is for experts only. And frankly, experts don't need 
                or want a book about home networking anyway. They're weenies.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#000080">I used to write 
                books for weenies. Heck, I used to be a weenie. But part of 
                maturing and growing up is that you learn to put things in 
                perspective. And my current perspective is that technology isn't 
                the reason I write about these topics. No, I write about these 
                topics because of what the technology enables.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#000080">Let me give you 
                an example. Since adding wireless networking to my home, my wife 
                and I can browse the Web, read email, or do anything else that 
                we used to do from a desktop computer, using a wireless-enabled 
                laptop or Tablet PC. The difference is, we can do it from the 
                couch, or from bed, or from the back yard even. We could even 
                use it from the bathroom if we wanted to, though no one is 
                owning up to that particular scenario. The point here is that 
                the wireless technology isn't what's cool. The good part is what 
                you can do with it.</font></p>
                <p>
                <font face="Verdana" color="#000080"><font size="2">Here's 
                another example. Let's say you want to share photos with family 
                members on the opposite coast. In the past, you might have 
                ordered double prints and sent them via snail mail when the 
                pictures came back from the photo developer. Today, you can hook 
                your digital camera to the PC, acquire the images, resize them 
                if needed, email select pictures to your family, and the use 
                Windows Messenger to chat about them in real time. And it all 
                happens nearly simultaneously. Again, the technology itself 
                isn't what's cool. It's what you do with that technology that 
                makes it worthwhile.</font></font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#000080">Simple 
                networking is changing the computer from an office-based 
                productivity tool to a more pervasive, life-enhancing 
                phenomenon. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#000080">Remember, it's
