                available, they've been applied to devices that have less and 
                less to do with computing. Of course, networking technologies 
                make sense for a certain range of connected devices, such as

                appropriate, in order to better serve customers' needs. 
                Currently, there are dozens of connected devices, including 
                portable audio players, digital audio receivers, TV photo

                Palm vs. Pocket PC: Two Mobile Challengers Improve in 2002</a><br>
                Portable computing devices based on the Palm OS have long 
                dominated the market, thanks largely to the simplicity of the 
                underlying software and a wealth of available add-on software 
                and hardware products. But devices based on Microsoft's 
                competing mobile platform, Pocket PC 2002, recently have made 
                strong gains in the market, especially with enterprises. The 
                Pocket PC is known primarily for its powerful Windows-like 
                environment, its compatibility with Microsoft Office 
                applications such as Word and Excel, and digital media features 
                such as video and music playback. To counter Microsoft's gains, 
                Palm and its OS licensees have advanced the Palm OS platform to 
                include many of the most popular Pocket PC features. So as we 
                move into the second half of 2002, let's evaluate these products 
                to see which platform is best for the connected home. <i>Source:

                Hub of a Connected Home: To PC or Not to PC</a><br>
                A new generation of connected entertainment devices is appearing 
                this year, and many of those devices seek to usurp control of 
                digital media tasks from the PC and move them into your living 
                room. I can understand why many people want to enjoy digital 
                photos and movies on their TV, which is usually much bigger than 
                their PC monitor. Likewise, stereo systems in people's living 
                rooms are often more powerful than the speakers connected to 
                their PCs and are in a more central spot in the home. No wonder 
                many companiesï¿½including some PC companies, incidentallyï¿½have 
                introduced products that work with TV and stereo technologies 
                and, in many cases, obviate the need for a PC. However, pushing 
                the PC out of the picture is often an extreme step that's not 
                necessarily the best way to go. The following are some emerging 
                digital media strategies to consider. <i>Source: Connected Home

                Adding Wireless to Your Home Network</a><br>
                After you have an Internet connection, perhaps shared among 
                several PCs on a home network, you might want to add wireless 
                capabilities. Today, most wireless connections use a technology 
                called Wi-Fi, the 802.11b wireless standard, which offers speeds 
                of up to 11Mbps, although you can usually pull in speeds closer 
                to 4Mbps to 8Mbps. During the past few years, wireless 
                connectivity has come down in price and become much easier to 
                install and configure. <i>Source: Connected Home Magazine, March

                How to Share Digital Photos</a><br>
                Digital photography lets us share and manage our personal 
                experiences in ways that are impossible with standard photo 
                film, thanks to the ubiquity of large hard disks, the Internet, 
                and other modern technologies. But the sheer number of ways you 
                can publish digital images might seem a bit overwhelming, 
                especially if you're just starting out. So let's look at some of 
                the best ways to enjoy your new digital freedom. <i>Source:

                Pocket PC: The Ultimate in Mobile Digital Media</a><br>
                In April 2000, Microsoft and its partners released the Pocket 
                PC, a handheld device based on Windows CE 3.0 that Microsoft 
                designed to compete with market-leader Palm OS. At the time, it 
                didn't seem to stand a chance because users had already ignored 
                all the previous products based on Microsoft's componentized OS 
                for small devices. But despite high prices and an unclear 
                future, the Pocket PC took off, especially Compaq's gorgeous 
                iPaq. Today, the Pocket PC is a force as the Palm OS continues 
                to lose market share. It reminds me of the early days of the 
                Internet Explorer (IE)/Netscape battle, although the outcome in 
                the handheld PC market is less certain.<i> Source: Connected

                Tunes to Go</a><br>
                Last summer, I began the arduous task of converting my audio CD 
                collection to MP3 format; the process involved inserting CDs one 
                at a time into my PC, running a software program such as Real 
                Jukebox or MusicMatch Jukebox, and ripping audio from the 
                CDs--one song at a time. I stored the songs in digital format on 
                my hard disk, and because of the quality settings I used, each 
                CD album occupies about 50MB of space, for the most part. If you 
                follow a similar process, you'll need a pretty big hard disk, 
                not to mention some sort of backup strategy, to archive your 
                whole CD collection. But when the process is complete, you'll 
                have the beginnings of a digital music collection that can be 
                used in a variety of ways. I say beginnings, because copying 
                music to the PC is only the first step. <i>Source: Connected

                Sharing Files Between OS X and a PC</b><br>
                If you've recently added a new iMac or other Apple Macintosh 
                computer to your home network, you've probably seen how easy it 
                is to share your PC-based Internet connection with the Mac. But 
                the Mac can also access your Windows-based files if you know the 
                trick. On Mac OS X, this capability it built-in, if hidden: To 
                access Windows-based file shares on OS X, select Go then Connect 
                to Server from the Finder menu and type the following address 
                into the Address text box:<br>
                <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; smb://[machine-name]/[share-name]<br>
                </i>where [machine-name] is the name of a valid Windows machine 
                and [share-name] is the name of a valid share point on that 
                machine. If you typed in a valid address, OS X will prompt you 
                to supply valid Windows workgroup name, user name, and password 
                information to access the share, and then add a shortcut to the 
                desktop from which you can navigate the share. OS 9 users--or OS 
                X users that wish to have their Mac appear as a Windows machine 
                on the network--will need to purchase a third-party application 
                for this functionality. I recommend

                Going Wireless<br>
                </b>Many people assume that you need to get a wireless access 
                point in order to add wireless devices to your home network, but 
                that's not the case. A thrifty alternative is to forego the 
                access point and simply install a wireless network interface 
                card (NIC) in one of your home PCs, and configure it to work in 
                ad-hoc, rather than infrastructure, mode. Then, any 
                wireless-equipped laptops can be configured this way, and you'll 
                be up and running, sans access point, and at a savings of at 
                least $100.</font><p>

                Backup<br>
                </b>Not that I needed the recent failure of my 30 GB data drive 
                to remind me, but when you begin storing all of your digital 
                photos, music, and videos on the PC, it's more important than 
                ever to backup regularly. I recommend a strict schedule, and if 
                you use some sort of calendaring program such as Outlook, MSN 
                Calendar, or Act, then be sure to set reminders so that you are 
                prompted to make backups every week or so. While it's possible 
                to use the built-in backup in Windows, it might be better to 
                back up to removable media such as CD or DVD. And make two 
                copies, bringing one off-site if possible. Remember: You can 
                never backup too much.<br>

                Networking XP with 9x/Me Machines<br>
                </b>If you move from Windows 9x/Me to XP in the coming days and 
                want to network your new PC or new OS with other machines in 
                your house, you need to remember a few key details. Unlike 
                9x/Me, XP was built with networking security in mind, so you'll 
                have to logon to an XP box before you can use it and, if you're 
                wise, you'll password protect that account as well. But once you 
                do this, you won't be able to access shares on your XP box from 
                9x/Me machines. Here's why: In a Windows workgroup based on NT, 
                2000, or XP, you must supply valid credentials (your 
                logon/password) before you can access network resources. And 
                these logons and associated passwords must be configured on any 
                XP (or NT/2000) machine on the network. So let's say you logon 
                as &quot;sally&quot; to a Windows 98 machine. To access an XP machine on 
                the same network, you'd have to set up a &quot;sally&quot; account on the 
                XP box that used the same password. Once you set it up like 
                this, accessing shares will work the same way it did with 9x/Me.</font></font><p>

                Old PC as a Media Server<br>
                </b>In the old days, people would often toss out an old PC when 
                the new one arrived, because PC technology moved along so fast 
                that the old one was often useless. Today, that's often no 
                longer the case, and any PC that's less than five years old can 
                often be repurposed as a spare PC for the kids, a gift to a 
                local school or charity, or you can use it as a dedicated media 
                server to store your audio, movie, and photo files. If you do 
                choose to go the media server route, be sure to purchase a new, 
                high-capacity hard drive first, and back up often. Then, put it 
                on your home network, and map drive letters to it from your 
                other PCs. I use a home media server for this purpose, and it 
                works fine on the wired Ethernet, home phone line, and wireless 
                networks we employ.<br>

                <b>Keep It Secure with Wireless</b><br>
                Following up on last week's tip, if you do go the wireless 
                route, be sure that you're securing your home network against 
                intrusion. Many wireless networks are automatically set up so 
                that someone with a wireless card could come by your house--or 
                live next door--and access your home network, and the Internet, 
                using your connection. To ensure that your data is safe, and 
                your network bandwidth isn't compromised from the outside, there 
                are a couple of simple things you can do. First, make sure your 
                wireless access point isn't broadcasting its SSID, which will 
                prevent most cards from even finding your network. Then, harden 
                your network from the outside, by hard coding the MAC addresses 
                of your wireless cards into the management software for your 
                access point, so that only your machines can use the network. Be 
                sure to use 128-bit encryption if possible, and if you're using 
                a bridged network, with wireless and wired components, consider 
                keeping them separate so that machines on the wireless network 
                can't access resources on the wired one. Also, be sure that 
                you've got the latest firmware update for your wireless access 
                point; many companies, such as Apple, Linksys, and others, have 
                shipped crucial security updates for their hardware.</font><br>
