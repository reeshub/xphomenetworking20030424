                wireless networking is evolving</a> at a rapid clip. Although 
                most wireless installations this year will likely be of the 
                11Mbps 802.11b (Wi-Fi) variety, newer, faster versions are 
                already superseding 802.11b. But the future of wireless isn't 
                all about faster speeds; it's also about lower prices and easier 
                configuration. As you might expect, Microsoft has an interest in 
                this market. <i>Source: Connected Home Magazine, April 17, 2002.</i></font></font></p>

                Hub of a Connected Home: To PC or Not to PC</a><br>
                A new generation of connected entertainment devices is appearing 
                this year, and many of those devices seek to usurp control of 
                digital media tasks from the PC and move them into your living 
                room. I can understand why many people want to enjoy digital 
                photos and movies on their TV, which is usually much bigger than 
                their PC monitor. <i>Source: Connected Home Magazine, April 3,

                Sharing an Internet Connection</a><br>
                You have a connection to the Internet�either through a dial-up 
                modem or a broadband solution such as cable modem, DSL, or 
                satellite�and a home network using wired or wireless solutions. 
                The next step is to connect the two and share your external 
                connection so that people using any PC on your home network can 
                access the Internet. Thanks to today's modern OSs, some simple 
                networking hardware, and a little know-how, sharing your 
                Internet connection is easier than ever. <i>Source: Connected

                Put the Internet Where You Want it to Be</a><br>
                Late last summer, I bought a Proxim Symphony wireless solution 
                for my home network, discovered I needed Windows 98 to configure 
                it, and promptly relegated it to the pile of electronic detritus 
                that decorates the corner of my office. Like many of you, I have 
                a pretty serious setup at home, something that is so far beyond 
                the statistical norm it'd be funny if it hadn't cost me so much. 
                A cable/DSL router mans my cable modem connection. The router 
                connects to a 100Mbps switch and the rest of my network, 
                currently three desktops and two laptops. But the limiting 
                factor is that all of the machines are in the same room: I've 
                never gotten around to wiring the whole house for Ethernet. And 
                over the past several months, my thoughts have turned again and 
                again to a wireless solution as an alternative, given my 
                reliance on Internet connectivity. So 2 weeks ago, I finally got 
                everything hooked up. I can't believe I waited this long. <i>

                Money When Going Wireless</b><br>
                Many people assume that you need to get a wireless access point 
                in order to add wireless devices to your home network, but 
                that's not the case. A thrifty alternative is to forego the 
                access point and simply install a wireless network interface 
                card (NIC) in one of your home PCs, and configure it to work in 
                ad-hoc, rather than infrastructure, mode. Then, any 
                wireless-equipped laptops can be configured this way, and you'll 
                be up and running, sans access point, and at a savings of at 
                least $100.</font><p>

                Even When on the Road</b><br>
                One of the coolest new features in Windows XP is Windows 
                Messenger, which lets you perform text chats and audio and video 
                conferencing. But video conferencing doesn't have to be work 
                related, despite its name: If you go on the road a lot, bring 
                along a Web camera and you can say goodnight to your family back 
                home, even when you're not there. Optimally, both sides of the 
                conversation (home and the traveler) will have a Web cam, so 
                they can see each other. It's the next best thing to being 
                there.</font><p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000080">
                <b>Keep It Secure with Wireless</b><br>
                Following up on last week's tip, if you do go the wireless 
                route, be sure that you're securing your home network against 
                intrusion. Many wireless networks are automatically set up so 
                that someone with a wireless card could come by your house--or 
                live next door--and access your home network, and the Internet, 
                using your connection. To ensure that your data is safe, and 
                your network bandwidth isn't compromised from the outside, there 
                are a couple of simple things you can do. First, make sure your 
                wireless access point isn't broadcasting its SSID, which will 
                prevent most cards from even finding your network. Then, harden 
                your network from the outside, by hard coding the MAC addresses 
                of your wireless cards into the management software for your 
                access point, so that only your machines can use the network. Be 
                sure to use 128-bit encryption if possible, and if you're using 
                a bridged network, with wireless and wired components, consider 
                keeping them separate so that machines on the wireless network 
                can't access resources on the wired one. Also, be sure that 
                you've got the latest firmware update for your wireless access 
                point; many companies, such as Apple, Linksys, and others, have 
                shipped crucial security updates for their hardware.</font><font face="Verdana"><br>
