                upgrading to new PCs would replace their existing machine with 
                the new one. Today, that's no longer true, largely because PCs 
                obsolete so much more slowly. So, people are augmenting their 
                current rigs with a new PC, and pawning off the existing PC on 
                another family member. Once you have two or more PCs in a home, 
                it's possible to connect, or network, them together in order to 
                share resources. For example, you might have a printer on one 
                machine: Wouldn't it be nice to print to that printer from the 
                second PC? There's no need to do the &quot;floppy shuffle&quot; any more,

                Palm vs. Pocket PC: Two Mobile Challengers Improve in 2002</a><br>
                Portable computing devices based on the Palm OS have long 
                dominated the market, thanks largely to the simplicity of the 
                underlying software and a wealth of available add-on software 
                and hardware products. But devices based on Microsoft's 
                competing mobile platform, Pocket PC 2002, recently have made 
                strong gains in the market, especially with enterprises. The 
                Pocket PC is known primarily for its powerful Windows-like 
                environment, its compatibility with Microsoft Office 
                applications such as Word and Excel, and digital media features 
                such as video and music playback. To counter Microsoft's gains, 
                Palm and its OS licensees have advanced the Palm OS platform to 
                include many of the most popular Pocket PC features. So as we 
                move into the second half of 2002, let's evaluate these products 
                to see which platform is best for the connected home. <i>Source:

                these technologies is easier than you might imagine, but first 
                you must have a general understanding of how to install home 
                networks and how to combine and connect computers so that 
                they're more useful and powerful than they would be on their 
                own. The first step, however, is to make a connection with the 
                outside world. For the past few decades, most people have 
                accomplished this connection through a dial-up modem, and 
                although this method is still popular today, broadband 
                connections such as cable modem, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), 
                and even satellite are now making headway. <i>Source: Connected

                Fun with Home Networking</a><br>
                My father was recently in town visiting and after he saw the 
                Apple iPod in my car, we started talking about digital media and 
                home networking. As I walked him through all the digital music, 
                photo, and video tasks I perform at home with my PC, I realized 
                that all this modern technology can be overwhelming; my father 
                was constantly amazed at what is possible today. Most amazing, 
                of course, is the price of this technology: Most of it is 
                inexpensive, although it can often be time-consuming to figure 
                out. <i>Source: Connected Home Magazine, February 6, 2002.</i></font><p>

                Almost Anything Is Possible with Wireless</a><br>
                I think most PC users are now comfortable with the concept of 
                wireless networking; modern wireless hardware and a 
                state-of-the-art OS such as Windows XP or Mac OS X are an 
                unbeatable combination. When you're connecting a home network, 
                however, wireless isn't always the best choice. I prefer to 
                connect desktop PCs in my home office by using 100Mbps Ethernet, 
                a wired solution that is less expensive and much faster than 
                wireless. For laptops in a home or office, however, wireless 
                access is crucial because of the mobility it offers. I like 
                being able to check email out on the deck on a nice day, or look 
                up important statistics online during my family's regular Sunday 
                afternoon football get-togethers. <i>Source: Connected Home

                Welcome to the Wireless Generation</a><br>
                Proxim's 1.6Mbps Symphony products offer an adequate solution 
                for home users who want simply to share a wireless Internet 
                connection. Proxim has upgraded its products to conform to the 
                HomeRF standard, but they're still 1.6Mbps and I don't think 
                that's enough, especially if you want to do any network file 
                sharing (HomeRF will run at 10Mbps). The 802.11b networking 
                offers a number of advantages over a HomeRF solution. In 
                addition to its much faster speed of 11Mbps, 802.11b-based 
                networks can be configured in various ways that make them more 
                appealing than other wireless solutions. <i>Source: Connected

                Sharing Files Between OS X and a PC</b><br>
                If you've recently added a new iMac or other Apple Macintosh 
                computer to your home network, you've probably seen how easy it 
                is to share your PC-based Internet connection with the Mac. But 
                the Mac can also access your Windows-based files if you know the 
                trick. On Mac OS X, this capability it built-in, if hidden: To 
                access Windows-based file shares on OS X, select Go then Connect 
                to Server from the Finder menu and type the following address 
                into the Address text box:<br>
                <i>smb://[machine-name]/[share-name]<br>
                </i>where [machine-name] is the name of a valid Windows machine 
                and [share-name] is the name of a valid share point on that 
                machine. If you typed in a valid address, OS X will prompt you 
                to supply valid Windows workgroup name, user name, and password 
                information to access the share, and then add a shortcut to the 
                desktop from which you can navigate the share. OS 9 users--or OS 
                X users that wish to have their Mac appear as a Windows machine 
                on the network--will need to purchase a third-party application 
                for this functionality. I recommend

                Going Wireless<br>
                </b>Many people assume that you need to get a wireless access 
                point in order to add wireless devices to your home network, but 
                that's not the case. A thrifty alternative is to forego the 
                access point and simply install a wireless network interface 
                card (NIC) in one of your home PCs, and configure it to work in 
                ad-hoc, rather than infrastructure, mode. Then, any 
                wireless-equipped laptops can be configured this way, and you'll 
                be up and running, sans access point, and at a savings of at 
                least $100.</font><p>
                <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000080"><b>Networking XP 
                with 9x/Me Machines<br>
                </b>If you move from Windows 9x/Me to XP in the coming days and 
                want to network your new PC or new OS with other machines in 
                your house, you need to remember a few key details. Unlike 
                9x/Me, XP was built with networking security in mind, so you'll 
                have to logon to an XP box before you can use it and, if you're 
                wise, you'll password protect that account as well. But once you 
                do this, you won't be able to access shares on your XP box from 
                9x/Me machines. Here's why: In a Windows workgroup based on NT, 
                2000, or XP, you must supply valid credentials (your 
                logon/password) before you can access network resources. And 
                these logons and associated passwords must be configured on any 
                XP (or NT/2000) machine on the network. So let's say you logon 
                as &quot;sally&quot; to a Windows 98 machine. To access an XP machine on 
                the same network, you'd have to set up a &quot;sally&quot; account on the 
                XP box that used the same password. Once you set it up like 
                this, accessing shares will work the same way it did with 9x/Me.</font><p>
                <font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000080"><b>Keep It Secure 
                with Wireless</b><br>
                Following up on last week's tip, if you do go the wireless 
                route, be sure that you're securing your home network against 
                intrusion. Many wireless networks are automatically set up so 
                that someone with a wireless card could come by your house--or 
                live next door--and access your home network, and the Internet, 
                using your connection. To ensure that your data is safe, and 
                your network bandwidth isn't compromised from the outside, there 
                are a couple of simple things you can do. First, make sure your 
                wireless access point isn't broadcasting its SSID, which will 
                prevent most cards from even finding your network. Then, harden 
                your network from the outside, by hard coding the MAC addresses 
                of your wireless cards into the management software for your 
                access point, so that only your machines can use the network. Be 
                sure to use 128-bit encryption if possible, and if you're using 
                a bridged network, with wireless and wired components, consider 
                keeping them separate so that machines on the wireless network 
                can't access resources on the wired one. Also, be sure that 
                you've got the latest firmware update for your wireless access 
                point; many companies, such as Apple, Linksys, and others, have 
                shipped crucial security updates for their hardware.</font><p>

                the Easy Way</b><br>
                The benefits to networking your home are pretty clear, 
                especially if you've recently purchased a new PC and want to 
                keep the older model in service. But wiring a home for CAT-5 
                Ethernet cable can be invasive and expensive. Instead, consider 
                wireless networking based on the 802.11b (&quot;Wi-Fi&quot;) standard. 
                Wireless network cards are relatively cheap, usually $100 or 
                less, you won't need an access point--the piece of hardware that 
                connects your wireless network to a more traditional wired 
                network--because Wi-Fi can work in &quot;ad-hoc&quot; mode (no access 
                point). So for $200, it's possible to connect two PCs 
                wirelessly, and these PCs can then be moved anywhere in the 
                house without a need to rewire or deal with cables. And with 
                speeds up to 11 Mbs per second, you won't experience delays.<br>
